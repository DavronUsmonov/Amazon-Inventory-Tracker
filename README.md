- This is an Amazon inventory tracker for helping amazon sellers track their inventory, lost shipments, 
incorrect shipments, manage their SKUs, and be able to get reimbursed for any losses.

-There is a separate backend and frontend folder for this project. They are completely separated so 
they must be run on their own servers. The frontend interacts with the server and database via the REST API.
